# Aurpay Promo Codes and Latest Aurpay Low-Fee Crypto Payment Deals for 2026

## Aurpay Introduction

Aurpay is a global blockchain technology company that's changing the way businesses handle cryptocurrency payments. Founded to make crypto transactions accessible to businesses of all sizes, Aurpay provides a comprehensive payment gateway that lets merchants accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, USDC, TRX, and over 50 other popular cryptocurrencies.

What makes Aurpay stand out is its non-custodial approach. Unlike traditional crypto exchanges where the platform controls your funds, Aurpay uses smart contracts to give you complete control over your private keys and payments. This means your money stays yours from the moment it arrives.

The platform serves everyone from small online shops to large enterprises, offering seamless integration with popular e-commerce platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, and PrestaShop. With transaction fees starting as low as 0.5%, Aurpay can save businesses thousands compared to traditional payment processors like PayPal, which typically charges 2.9% plus fixed fees per transaction.

Aurpay's smart contract technology also delivers significant cost savings on gas fees. While other platforms might charge you $2 per transaction in network fees, Aurpay's batch processing means you pay just one gas fee for up to 1,000 orders. That's a potential saving of $2,000 per thousand transactions.
